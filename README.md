# Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé Games: A Short Introduction

This repository contains a short expository article on **Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games (EF games)**,
written as part of the Model Theory course (LOG211) at the University of Gothenburg.

The note covers:

- Motivation: EF games as a tool to compare structures by first-order logic
- Basic definitions: languages, structures, partial isomorphisms, EF_k, k-equivalence
- Main ideas and examples: back-and-forth strategies, dense linear orders, and a Spoiler win
- Main result: Ehrenfeucht's theorem (stated) and several fully worked proofs
- Historical notes and references (Hodges, Libkin, Väänänen, Dawar, Marchionne)
